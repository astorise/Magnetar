# conformance Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change define-reference-cpu-provider-and-kernel-baseline. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Reference CPU Conformance Baseline

Reference CPU Provider SHALL provide or participate in conformance baselines for
supported Operators.

#### Scenario: Matmul conformance

Given Reference CPU matmul is implemented

When conformance runs

Then its output is validated against Operator semantics and tolerance profile.

---

### Requirement: Reference CPU Fixtures Avoid GPU Dependency

Reference CPU conformance fixtures SHALL not require external GPU hardware.

#### Scenario: CPU-only environment

Given tests run on CPU-only machine

When Reference CPU conformance executes

Then supported fixtures can run without GPU.

---

### Requirement: Reference CPU Can Compare Optimized Kernels

Any comparison of Reference CPU outputs against optimized Provider Kernels SHALL respect the declared tolerance profile for the Operator under test.
Reference CPU outputs MAY be used for such comparisons.

#### Scenario: CUDA comparison

Given CUDA matmul Kernel exists

When conformance compares outputs

Then Reference CPU output may be used as baseline if policy allows it.
